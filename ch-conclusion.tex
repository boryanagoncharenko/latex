\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The variability of CSS conventions used in practice cannot be handled by
existing tools. Thus, developers often need to make sure their code complies
to a given style guide manually. The thesis offers a solution to this problem.
The contribution of this thesis is threefold:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, the need for CSS conventions is evaluated and evidence
	that CSS is still handcrafted is provided.
	\item Second, a list of the existing code conventions and their analysis
	is presented.
	\item Third, a domain-specific language that is capable of expressing the
	gathered conventions is proposed.
\end{enumerate}

A prototype of language and its interpreter are implemented to enable
automatic detection of violations.
