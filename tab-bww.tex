\textbf{Ontological construct} & \textbf{Explanation} \\
 &  \\
\hline
Thing & The elementary unit in the BWW ontological model. The real world is made up of things. A composite thing may be made up of other things (composite or primitive).~\cite{wand1995deep} \\ 
\hline
Properties & \multirow{7}{30em}{Things possess properties. A property is modeled via a function that maps the thing into some value. A property of a composite thing that belongs to a component thing is called an hereditary property. Otherwise it is called an emergent property. A property that is inherently a property of an individual thing is called an intrinsic property. A property that is meaningful only in the context of two or mode things is called a mutual or relational property.~\cite{wand1995deep}} \\

 \hline
 State & A vector of values for all property functions of a thing.~\cite{wand1995deep} \\
 \hline
 Event & A change of state of a thing. It is affected via a transformation.~\cite{wand1995deep} \\
 \hline
 Transformation & A mapping from a domain comprising states to a codomain comprising states.~\cite{wand1995deep} \\
 \hline
 History & The chronologically ordered states that a thing traverses.~\cite{weber1996analytical} \\
 \hline
 Coupling & A thing acts on another thing if its existence affects the history of the other thing. The two things are said to be coupled or interact.~\cite{wand1995deep} \\
 \hline
 Class & A class is a set of things that can be defined via their possessing a characteristic property.~\cite{weber1996analytical} \\ 
 \hline
 Subclass & A set of things that can be defined via their possessing the set of properties in
a class plus an additional set of properties.~\cite{weber1996analytical} \\ 
\hline
 System & A set of things is a system if, for any bi-partitioning of the set, couplings exist among things in the two subsets.~\cite{wand1995deep} \\
 \hline
 System Composition & The things in the system are its composition.~\cite{wand1995deep} \\
 \hline
 System Environment &  Things that are not in the system but interact with things in the system are called the environment of the system.~\cite{wand1995deep} \\
