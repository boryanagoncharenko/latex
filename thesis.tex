\abstract{    

Code conventions are meant to preserve code base consistency and express
preference of a particular programming style. Often, code conventions are
expressed in natural language and it is a responsibility of the developers to
read, understand and apply them. Typically, developers need to ensure that
their code complies to a given style guide manually. There are a number of
tools that can automatically detect violations of conventions. However,
current solutions remain rigid or with limited scope. This thesis
presents a tool that solves this problem. The proposed solution consists of a
domain--specific language that expresses custom CSS conventions and an
interpreter of the language capable of finding violations automatically.

First, the need for CSS conventions is evaluated based on whether CSS is still
handcrafted. Second, existing CSS code conventions are discovered and
analyzed. Third, a domain--specific language capable of expressing existing CSS
code conventions is designed.
