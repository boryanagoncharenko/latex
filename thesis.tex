\abstract{    

Code conventions are meant to preserve code base consistency and express
preference of a particular programming style. Often, code conventions are
expressed in natural language and it is a responsibility of the developers to
read, understand and apply them. Typically, developers need to ensure that
their code complies to a given style guide manually. There are a number of
tools that can automatically detect violations of conventions. However,
current solutions remain rigid, laborious or with limited scope. The solution
presented in this thesis solves this problem. It consists of a domain--specific 
language that expresses existing CSS conventions and its interpreter
that finds violations automatically.

First, the need for CSS conventions is evaluated based on whether CSS is still
handcrafted. Second, existing CSS code conventions are discovered and
analyzed. Third, a domain-specific language capable of expressing existing CSS
code conventions is designed. The thesis contains a specification of the
designed domain--specific language and an implementation of its interpreter
that detects violations automatically.
